# Mastering Next.js — Complete Guide Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content Generation
All book content will be AI-generated by Claude, adhering to the "AI generated Next.js book using Claude integrating Spec-Kit Plus and Docusaurus." mission. Content must be technically accurate and aligned with best practices.

### II. Target Audience Focus
Content must be tailored for "Students + New Web Devs", ensuring clarity, gradual complexity from "Basic to Advanced", and practical relevance through "2 Real Projects."

### III. Structured Content & Format
All generated documentation will follow a structured "Chapters: Basic to Advanced + 2 Real Projects" outline. The output format MUST be "Markdown for Docusaurus" and reside at the "Docs Output Path: ./my-book/docs/".

### IV. Spec-Kit Plus Integration
The book generation process will integrate Spec-Kit Plus workflows for managing specifications, plans, and tasks. All PHRs and ADRs will be created as per Spec-Kit Plus guidelines.

### V. Documentation Output
The final output for the book will be Markdown files suitable for Docusaurus, located in the `./my-book/docs/` directory.

### VI. Version Control & Traceability
All generated content and project artifacts must be version-controlled. Prompt History Records (PHRs) will ensure traceability of AI-generated content.

## Content Standards

Content must be free of plagiarism, technically sound, and free of grammatical errors. Code examples must be functional and well-explained.

## Review and Iteration

Content will undergo review to ensure accuracy and adherence to the target audience's learning curve. Iterative improvements will be made based on feedback.

## Governance
This Constitution serves as the foundational document for the "Mastering Next.js — Complete Guide" project. Amendments require review and approval by relevant stakeholders. All content generation and project activities must comply with the principles outlined herein. Prompt History Records (PHRs) are mandatory for every user interaction, and Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) will be suggested for significant decisions.
